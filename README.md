# Atari Game Player Reinforcement Learning Agent

This repository implements a reinforcement learning agent using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to play Atari games. The agent learns to perform optimally in a discrete action space, leveraging deep learning techniques to interact with complex game environments.

## Overview

This project serves as an example of applying reinforcement learning techniques to classic Atari games, demonstrating how deep neural networks can be employed to approximate Q-values and guide decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Uses deep learning to approximate Q-values for discrete action spaces.
- **Atari Game Environment**: Supports popular Atari games such as Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders.
