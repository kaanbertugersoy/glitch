# Glitch – Reinforcement Learning Agent For Playing Atari Games

**Status: Archived – No Longer Maintained**

Glitch is a reinforcement learning project that implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent designed to play classic Atari games. The agent learns to make optimal decisions in a discrete action space using deep neural networks to approximate Q-values.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to Atari game environments using deep learning techniques. It serves as a reference or starting point for those interested in building game-playing AI agents.

Supported environments include:

- Pong
- Breakout
- Space Invaders  
*(and other Atari games via Gymnasium)*

## Key Features

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** Learns Q-value approximations through deep neural nets.
- **Atari Environment Integration:** Utilizes environments from the Arcade Learning Environment (via OpenAI Gym).
- **Discrete Action Space:** Handles finite, defined sets of game actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Virtualenv (recommended)
- Gymnasium (with Atari support)
- TensorFlow

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
